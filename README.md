# CSC484 HW4: Decision Making and Learning

This program visualizes a decision tree and behavior tree applying steering behaviors, path finding algorithms, and other algorithms.

## Building the Program

Simply run "./builder.sh" to build program and run it. You may need to enable permissions which may bee done via "chmod u+x builder.sh". Alternatively you can call "make" to build it. However, if you change a header file you must call "make clean" as "make" will not pickup the dependency change!

## Running the Program
The builder.sh script will build and run the program. If you chose to manually make the program, run "./main" to launch the program. The exectuable "main" is the exectuable for the entire program.
