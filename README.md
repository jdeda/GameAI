# CSC484 HW4: Decision Making and Learning
This program visualizes a decision tree, behavior tree, and a decision tree learning algorithm working with steering behaviors and path finding algorithms.

## Building the Program
Simply run "builder.sh" to build program and run it. You may need to enable permissions which may bee done via "chmod u+x builder.sh". Alternatively you can call "make" to build it. However, if you change a header file you must call "make clean" as "make" will not pickup the dependency change!

## User Input
The program will prompt you for a visualizer:
1. Decision Tree
2. Behavior Tree
3. Decision Tree Learning 
Simply chose to your liking.
